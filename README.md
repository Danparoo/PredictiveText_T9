# PredictiveText_T9
The system of predictive text (also called “T9”) was devised. The user presses each key only once and the mobile phone uses a dictionary to guess what word is being typed using a dictionary, and displays the possible matches. So the word “hello” can be typed in 5 button presses “43556” without pauses, instead of 12 in the standard system. The numeric string “43556” is referred to as a “signature ” of the world “hello”. If this is the only match, the user can press space and carry on. If there are multiple matches, the user might need to select one of them before proceeding.
